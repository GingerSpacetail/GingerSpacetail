- NLP (from patient records or biopsy reports to molecular design), 
- Computer vision problems in medical imaging (e.g. organs, tissues, target structures delineation), 
- ML for radiology and radiotherapy (e.g. image biomarkers feature extraction, classification problems for malignant /benign tumor, 
                                                  dose delivery and distribution,
                                                  SPECT/PET/MRI reconstruction algorithms improvement), 
 - DL deployment in genomics, radiomics, multi-omics.
